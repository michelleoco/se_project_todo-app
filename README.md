# Simple Todo App

A simple “to-do” application. Existing JavaScript was refactored in OOP for this project.

## Functionality

The application includes a button to add a to-do item. The pop-up form takes the task to be done and the date that it needs to be done by. There are checkboxes in the app to click when the tasks are completed and delete buttons to delete tasks.

## Technology

Html, CSS, and Javascript were used. Javascript was refactored in OOP, creating the Todo and FormValidator classes to ensure each performs specific tasks.

A uuid package was imported to create unique IDs for to-do items.
